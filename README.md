# Blipper
Welcome to Blipper, a new social media site for a modern Web. User account creation is coming in the future. Currently we have the functionality to post messages, like messages, and follow users.

# Usage
First, navigate to the backend directory and enter "rails s" into your terminal to launch the server. 
Once that is up and running, open a second terminal tab, switch to the "frontend" directory and enter "npm start."

# Contributing
