# Blipper

Welcome to Blipper, a new social media site for a modern Web. User account creation is coming in the future, but for now, we have the ability to post "Blips," our name for your voice on our site, your messages to the world. You can like other users' Blips, follow users you like, and explore our aquatic-themed site.

# Usage

First, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
> npm install react-router-dom
> npm install --save react-redux
> npm install --save redux-thunk
> npm install --save redux-devtools-extension

Navigate to the "blipper_backend" directory and enter "rails s" into your terminal to launch the server. Once that is up and running, switch to the "blipper_frontend" directory and enter "npm start."
